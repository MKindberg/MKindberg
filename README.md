# Projects
My more useful/interesting repos

## Cli applications
A collection of more or less useful cli applications. Mostly created to explore a topic or two but some (eg grt) turned out to be surprisingly useful.
### [grt](https://github.com/mkindberg/grt)

A tool for downloading commits from Gerrit without leaving the terminal. Makes it simpler to download multiple commits or topics.

### [openhab-tui](https://github.com/mkindberg/openhab-tui)
 An exporation of Go and Charm to create a TUI that can be used to control lights and other smart things connected to openHAB.

### [truss](https://github.com/mkindberg/truss)
Played around with RSS and wrote an rss reader that runs in the terminal.

### [good_morning](https://github.com/mkindberg/good_morning)
Wanted a way to start Sonos speakers and openhab things at a specific time without having to set an alarm in multiple apps.

## Language servers
Got curious about language servers and started exploring what they can to

### [zig-lsp-server](https://github.com/mkindberg/zig-lsp-server)
Noticed that there was a lot of duplicate code in the servers and extraced the common code into a library which simplified a lot.

### [censor-ls](https://github.com/mkindberg/censor-ls)
Makes it easier to avoid using user specified words by marking them with a diagnositc in the editor and possibly suggesting alternative words to use.

### [test-ls](https://github.com/mkindberg/test-ls)
Automatically run Zig unit tests on save and report.

## Tutorials
### [monkeylang](https://github.com/mkindberg/monkeylang)
Exploring how compilers work by following the books "Writing an interpreter in Go" and "Writing a compiler in Go" but changing the language to Rust.

### [zig-kilo](https://github.com/mkindberg/zig-kilo)
Was curious about how text editors worked, followed [this tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) but wrote it in Zig. Also started to add some additional small features.
