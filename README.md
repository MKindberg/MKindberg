My more useful/interesting repos

## Cli applications
A collection of more or less useful cli applications. Mostly created to explore a topic or two but some (eg grt) turned out to be surprisingly useful.
### [grt](https://github.com/mkindberg/grt)

A tool for downloading commits from Gerrit without leaving the terminal. Makes it simpler to download multiple commits or topics.

### [openhab-tui](https://github.com/mkindberg/openhab-tui)

 An exporation of Go and [Charm](https://charm.sh/) to create a TUI that can be used to control lights and other smart things connected to openHAB. The TUI can either be started manually when needed or on a server and accessed over ssh.
</br></br></br></br></br></br>

### [truss](https://github.com/mkindberg/truss)

Played around with RSS and wrote an rss reader that runs in the terminal.
</br></br></br></br></br>

## Services
Some tools doesn't need an interface.

### [good_morning](https://github.com/mkindberg/good_morning)
Wanted a way to start Sonos speakers and openhab things at a specific time without having to set an alarm in multiple apps.

## Language servers
Got curious about language servers and started exploring what they can do.

### [zig-lsp-server](https://github.com/mkindberg/zig-lsp-server)
Noticed that there was a lot of duplicate code in the servers and extraced the common code into a library which simplified a lot.

### [censor-ls](https://github.com/mkindberg/censor-ls)
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc45b43a-1fcd-430a-9f17-6def7352afc2" alt="censor-ls config and warnings" width="60%" align=left />
Makes it easier to avoid using user specified words by marking them with a diagnositc in the editor and possibly suggesting alternative words to use.
</br></br></br>

### [test-ls](https://github.com/mkindberg/test-ls)
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4096507b-defd-4325-834e-c7c2bcd99f07" alt="test-ls results" width="30%" align=right />
Automatically run Zig unit tests on save and report the results though diagnostics and hover text.

## Tutorials
### [monkeylang](https://github.com/mkindberg/monkeylang)
Exploring how compilers work by following the books [Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) and [Writing a compiler in Go](https://compilerbook.com/) but changing the language to Rust.

### [zig-kilo](https://github.com/mkindberg/zig-kilo)
Was curious about how text editors worked, followed [this tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) but wrote it in Zig. Also started to add some additional small features.
